# Enhanced word search on qualtrics

This repository is a fork of the original project by \link[https://github.com/rcalinjageman]
The original repository can be found here: \link[https://github.com/rcalinjageman/word_search].

## Purpose of this fork
This fork is being used to advance/alter the original word search task to:
- Add timer (5 minutes by default) to original word search
- Change word search to prime for cooperation (words can be found in \link{Stapel & Koomen 2005}[https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2005-06516-010]
- Auto-advance after either all words have been found or the timer has run out
- Record the number of words found in qualtrics, and when they were found

## Current status
Work in progress. Changes are ongoing and not yet finalized.

## Notes
This repository may diverge from the original implementation.
